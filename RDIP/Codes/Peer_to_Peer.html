    <h1>Explaining Peer to Peer</h1>
    <p>
      The sheet contains information of the evaluatee (student who solved the issues), commit urls pertaining to each issue and an evaluator(student who has to validate the issues) assigned to each evaluatee. Please go through the sheet and identify the evaluatee who's issues you have to check.

Steps to Evaluate:
Step - 1: Open the commit url on github. Note the path down that looks like src/lab/(that can be found to the extreme left of the Split button which again can be found below the commit id hash).
Step - 2: Just below the split button, three dots are visible. Click it, and go to view file
Step - 3: Copy the contents of the file from top to bottom, and paste it into your text editor
Step - 4: Save the file as <name>.html(Example: Manual.html or Experiment.html)
Step - 5: Open that file using your web browser
Step - 6: Using the file path that you noted down in Step - 1, refer to this sheet that shows the original experiment(find the path in the sheet) and compare the Step - 5 file running in the browser with the current original experiment.
